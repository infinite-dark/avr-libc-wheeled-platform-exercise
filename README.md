# AVR LibC - Wheeled Platform Exercise

This microproject was made to learn how to program an Atmel AVR microcontroller (in this case the ATmega328P) using the AVR LibC library on a practical example. The project is very primitive and involves utilizing timer-counters and analog-to-digital converter to drive two DC motors in a simple wheeled mobile platform through a joystick. The difficulties to overcome included understanding the configuration registers and deriving a way to obtain ADC readings.

Please don't judge how the setup looks :)

My intention for publishing this project on GitHub was purely technical - to share the code without resorting to manually adding project collaborators. The problem is that GitHub doesn't allow for "unlisted" repositories in the same way as, for example, YouTube allows for "unlisted" videos. I'm therefore forced to publish the repo even if I do not want to do that whatsoever (especially considering the legal issues).
